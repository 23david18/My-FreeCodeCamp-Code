/* Bonfire: No repeats please
Difficulty: 4/5

Return the number of total permutations of the provided string that don't have repeated consecutive letters.

For example, 'aab' should return 2 because it has 6 total permutations, but only 2 of them don't have the same letter (in this case 'a') repeating.

Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.
