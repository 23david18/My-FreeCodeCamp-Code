# My Work From FreeCodeCamp

This repository is not for an app but more as a journal where I keep a record of everything I have done and learned from FreeCodeCamp. I decided to use a wiki as I can put more information easily on it. You will find my code there and also onthe right directories if you just want to see the code.

I will try to keep everythign updated. If you are also part of the camp or would like to contribute in any way then feel free to contact me. The purpose of this is for reference and learning material overall, for everyone as it is public.

## Wiki Status:

Since I practically started the wiki a few days ago and just today I came up with what I wanted to do with it, I have added some basic pages, particularly for the Bornfires but more explanation should be added and more content covered.
